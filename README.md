# Odin Recipes

## Description

This barebones project assigned by the The Odin Project curriculum exercises basic HTML authoring. In it, there is an index page, which links to three recipes taken from [AllRecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/).

This project exercises basic HTML authoring, using list elements (ordered and unordered), images, links, and basic text tags (headers and paragraphs).

## Steps

1. Create a local directory called `odin-recipes` and initialize a git repository
2. Add `index.html`, `README.md`, and `recipes/`
3. Create three recipe pages including:

	- A title header of the recipe
	- An image of the finished dish
	- A description header followed by an appropriate paragraph
	- An ingredients header followed by an unordered list of necessary ingredients
	- A steps header followed by an ordered list of steps
	- A link back to `index.html`

4. In `index.html`:

	 - A title header
	 - Add links to each recipe

5. Use GitHub pages to host the webpage.
